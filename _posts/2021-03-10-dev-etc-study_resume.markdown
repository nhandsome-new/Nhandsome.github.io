## Describe
> Making LaTeX Resumes (EN, JP) based on  [`Deedy CV`](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz)<br>

## Intro
 I was surprised a little, because the preparation for employment in Japan started ealier then my expectation. I think I've just wasted time without properly organizing my reserch activities, personal study and so on. So from now, I try to manage them periodically. As a first step, I tried writing a resume using LaTeX.

## Github link (Sample resume and codes)
 [LaTeX CV En and Jp version](https://github.com/Nhandsome/LaTeX_resume)

## Description
- I wrote them based on the original codes of [`Deedy CV`](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz).
- Deedy_CV : Only modifed the spacing and font size
- Deedy_CV_Japanese : Modifed to use Japanese Font and Added a Photo section
